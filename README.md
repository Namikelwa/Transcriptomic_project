# Anopheles project
In this project we are working on reproducing results from a research paper by Mangâ€™era et al. [link](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-020-04505-4).   
Briefly the study involved two groups consisting of 3rd & 4th instar larvae of *An.gambiae* .One group was exposed to curry tree leaf extract pytochemicals which disrupted  growth and development by inducing morphogenetic abnormalities,reducing locomotion and delaying pupation.While the other group was not exposed(control).The study sought to investigate which transcriptional process in the larvae underpins the above phenotype in the mosquito?

RNA was isolated and sequenced using Illumina Hiseq platform.Overall four transcriptome sequences were generated from the samples (two each for control and exposed larvae).We will be documenting the RNA Seq analysis workflow used to reproduce the findings.
