# Anopheles project
## Transcriptomic response of *An. gambiae s.s* mosquito larvae to Curry tree (Murraya koenigii) phytochemicals by Mangâ€™era et.al
Curry tree leaf extract pytochemicals are shown to disrupt growth and development of An.gambiae by inducing morphogenetic abnormalities,reducing locomotion and delaying pupation.
* Question

Which transcriptional process in the larvae underpins the above phenotype in the mosquito?

* Workflow

The study involved two groups of exposed and non-exposed 3rd & 4th instar larvae.RNA from the samples was isolated and sequenced in Illumina Hiseq platform after which the data obtained was analysed using bioinformatics tools.
